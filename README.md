# js-async-await

### JavaScript Promises- Asynchronous Code

This Git repository is dedicated to exploring asynchronous JavaScript code using promises and later with async/await. The exercises involve making requests to external APIs and manipulating data asynchronously.

##### Part 1: Number Facts

1. Make a request to the Numbers API to get a fact about your favorite number. (Ensure JSON response by including the `json` query key.)
2. Retrieve data on multiple numbers in a single request and display all number facts on the page.
3. Use the API to get 4 facts on your favorite number. Display them on the page, even if some facts are repeated.

##### Part 2: Deck of Cards

1. Make a request to the Deck of Cards API to get a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Log the value and suit.
2. Request two cards from the same deck and log the values and suits of both cards.
3. Build an HTML page to draw cards from a deck. Create a new deck on page load and allow drawing cards until the deck is empty.

##### Further Study

1. Make a single request to the Pokemon API to get names and URLs for every Pokemon in the database.
2. Pick three Pokemon at random, make requests to their URLs, and log the data for each Pokemon.
3. Extend the code from task 2 to store Pokemon names in a variable, make additional requests to their species URLs, and log the species descriptions in English.
   Example: "ducklett: They are better at swimming than flying, and they happily eat their favorite food, peat moss, as they dive underwater."
